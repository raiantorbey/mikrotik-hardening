Mirkrotik Router Hardening
This project contains a Python script that automates security hardening for MikroTik routers by interacting with the RouterOS API using the librouteros library. It streamlines repetitive manual tasks such as disabling unnecessary services (FTP, Telnet, WWW), changing the default Winbox port for improved security, and creating a new secure administrative user. This script is designed to help network admins efficiently secure multiple MikroTik devices in larger environments or automate routine security configurations.
